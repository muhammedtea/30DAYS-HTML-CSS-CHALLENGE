DAY-03

## I learnt about HTML Styles. the HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size and others.

It consist of the tagname then we used style = to give the property value.

for example to set a background color for two different elements in the body

we use h1 style = "background-color: "any type of color" ;
